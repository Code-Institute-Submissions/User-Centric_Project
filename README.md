# User-Centric FrontEnd-Project

## Cafe Panino
- An imaginary Italian-style cafe website selling real Italian coffees and authentic homemade Italian breads
  with a broad choice of Italian flavours, aromas and textures all sourced from Italy herself!

### Overview
This website is for people who are hungry from the breakfast hours to the late afternoon.
It exists to cater for those who like and enjoy Italian sandwiches and coffee and for those who'd like to sample
the experience for the first time.

# UX

When a user lands at the website they are greeted with the name of the cafe and a big inviting image of a freshly
made cup of coffee with the promise that they will receive an Italian dining experience. Also there is the navigation menu 
just above the image with options to see the sandwich menu items available, look at some of the top sellers, read past 
customers' comments, take a pre-order booking and also how to reach out and contact the cafe.
The nav menu is easily readable and when clicked on will take the user directly to their chosen section. I decided to keep 
the entire site scrollable with no seperate page links as this will keep the users' attention so that they can achieve their 
goal which is to pre-choose what they want to eat then have the option to come to the cafe or contact via email or phone to 
place their order.

#Content

As a chef of many years I have experience of what it takes to create a satisfying meal.
I drew on my experience working in a sandwich cafe for six years and also in an Italian restaurant for 10 years.
The sandwich menu items and descriptions of fillings were a product of that life experience.
